# explain-this
explain-this will attempt to use public resources (dictionary, Wikipedia) to define a topic. It then uses a list of related words as context to select the best Wikipedia page or definition by scanning the pages.

You can think of it as one of the Google explanation cards when you search for a topic. I'm hoping to add image support soon, too.
